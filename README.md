# Hack-Assembler
My implementation of the hack assembler described in 'elements of computing systems'


The lexer breaks the file into a list of lists, each sub list has discrete elements that are easier to manipulate. Codewrite has basic utilitities for fetching the binary code assosciated with a comand, and everything is put together with several loops in the assebler module
